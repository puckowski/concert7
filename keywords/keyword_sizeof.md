# Keyword sizeof

## Description

Returns the size of a variable.

## Notes

Size represents the number of bytes used by that variable.

## Example

```cpp
int numArray 100 = 0;
int sizeOfNumArray = 0;

# sizeOfNumArray is set to 400.
# sizeOfNumArray is of type int (4 bytes) and is an array of size of 100, so 400 bytes are used in all.
sizeof numArray sizeOfNumArray;
```
