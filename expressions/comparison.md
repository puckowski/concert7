## Equal to example

```cpp
if x == y;
    print "x equals y";
else; 
    print "x does not equal y";
end;
```

## Not equal to example

```cpp
if x != y;
    print "x does not equal y";
else; 
    print "x equals y";
end;
```

## Less than example

```cpp
if x < y;
    print "x is less than y";
else; 
    print "x is greater than or equal to y";
end;
```

## Greater than example

```cpp
if x > y;
    print "x is greater than y";
else; 
    print "x is less than or equal to y";
end;
```

## Less than or equal to example

```cpp
if x <= y;
    print "x is less than or equal to y";
else; 
    print "x is greater than y";
end;
```

## Greater than or equal to example

```cpp
if x >= y;
    print "x is greater than or equal to y";
else; 
    print "x is less than y";
end;
```
